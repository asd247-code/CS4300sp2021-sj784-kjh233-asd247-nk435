# Fanfiction Playlist

## Tasks

- Scraping / Dataset management (next week)
    1. add more contemporary artists from more diverse genres (27.5k right now -> aim for 50k next week)
        - R&B, indie rock, 60s & 70s, or 2021
        - a list of artists by Wednesday -> Natalie
    2. get rid of non-English artists from the database ascii 
        - Ariel

- Algorithm Develop:
    1. improve accuracy by doing more text pre-preocessing to the query (aka query adjustment)
    2. try 2 or 3 ngram models (require larger dataset)
    3. properly handle unknown words in the query
    4. try experiment with tfidf hyperparameters
    5. try lemmatization and stemming before processing

- Evaluation:
    1. need more fanfictions and human labeled outputs for evaluation
    - Google search on fanfictions that already have playlists
    - Antonio -> get a google doc by Wed

- Prototype (due in a week)
    1. front-end: build basic code to get the app running on flask for next week's prototype
      - Kirk -> Wednesday meetup
    2. back-end: cosine similarity (done)
    3. back-end: data storing (need more efficient methods)
